Summary
The provided text is a proposed README.md template for a GitHub repository titled "IEA App Educativa 2025," outlining an open-source educational application for the Instituto de Educación de Aguascalientes (IEA). Its purpose is to create a collaborative system using AI for managing school processes like schedules, attendance, assignments, and reports, emphasizing legal compliance with Mexican laws and ethical data handling. The scope is limited to suggestive, non-official tools that do not replace IEA's existing systems (e.g., SIPPE), with a focus on using synthetic data until formal authorization is obtained.

Key Issues
Data Handling and Privacy: The template mandates use of anonymized or fictitious data and encrypted storage, but ambiguities exist in how parental consent is obtained for real data integration, potentially exposing student information if not strictly enforced.
Integration with Official Systems: It explicitly states the app does not substitute SIPPE, but planned features like API connections could inadvertently create dependencies or data flows that mimic official processes, deviating from standard educational software by introducing AI orchestration without clear audit trails.
Authorization Requirements: Reliance on a "convenio de colaboración" (collaboration agreement) with IEA is noted, but the template lacks details on how to handle IP rights for cloned or derived IEA processes, creating risks if public documents are adapted without explicit permission.
AI and Autonomy Concerns: AI components (e.g., Azure OpenAI) are positioned as "secure," but autonomous suggestions (e.g., for grades or schedules) could lead to biases or errors, unusual for educational tools where human oversight is typically mandatory.
Licensing and Open-Source Risks: MIT license with LGPDPPSO clause is proposed, but open-sourcing code that interfaces with government systems might expose vulnerabilities or allow unauthorized forks, diverging from proprietary edtech norms.
Legal References
Ley General de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de Sujetos Obligados (LGPDPPSO), Art. 70-113: Requires explicit consent and data minimization for student records; the template's emphasis on fictitious data aligns, but real integrations must include impact assessments to avoid fines up to 2% of annual revenue.
Ley General de Educación (LGE), Art. 73-74: Governs educational data management; the non-substitution clause complies, but any data export features must ensure no unauthorized disclosure.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g: If Azure or U.S.-based tools process data, parental consent is required for student records; violations could lead to funding cuts or penalties.
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506: Applies to apps collecting data from minors; the template's consent mention is a start, but verifiable mechanisms are needed to avoid FTC fines up to $50,120 per violation.
Precedent: Owasso Independent School Dist. No. 011 v. Falvo, 534 U.S. 426 (2002): Limits FERPA to institutional records, supporting the template's focus on non-official outputs but underscoring the need for clear separations from government systems.
Recommendations
Clarify Consent and Data Flows: Add a dedicated section in the README requiring EIPD (Evaluación de Impacto en Protección de Datos) before any real data use; implement opt-in forms with CURP verification for parents.
Strengthen IP and Authorization: Include a template "convenio" clause specifying IEA's explicit approval for any adaptations of public documents; restrict open-source contributions to prevent unauthorized modifications.
Enhance AI Safeguards: Mandate human approval for all AI-generated outputs in code comments; integrate bias audits for features like task feedback to mitigate risks.
Add Disclaimer Language: Expand the "Cláusula obligatoria" to explicitly state: "This software is not endorsed by IEA unless a signed agreement is in place; users assume all liability for data handling."
Testing Protocol: Recommend beta testing with synthetic data only, followed by IEA review; consider local hosting to avoid cross-border data issues under CCPA equivalents
